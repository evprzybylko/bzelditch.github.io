Well, here it is: my first post on this site. The plan is for this to be a space where I can post my thoughts on anything that I find interesting and worth sharing. </br>
I suspect that most posts here will revolve around a book/article I've read, a movie I've watched, or a mathematical/statistical/economic principle I've finally wrapped </br>
my head around, but your guess is as good as mine. More to come later. Stay tuned.
